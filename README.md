## ‚öôÔ∏è Working Principle
1. **Input Signal Generation** ‚Äì Two ECG signals are created:  
   - A *normal ECG* representing a healthy cardiac rhythm.  
   - An *abnormal ECG* with added noise and irregularities simulating arrhythmia.  

2. **Signal Comparison (Sum Block)** ‚Äì The difference between normal and abnormal ECGs is calculated to identify deviations or error signals.  

3. **PID Controller** ‚Äì Adjusts the waveform dynamically to minimize the error, aligning the arrhythmic signal with the healthy reference.  

4. **Transfer Function** ‚Äì Filters and refines the corrected ECG waveform for smoother output.  

5. **Saturation Block** ‚Äì Limits the amplitude of corrections to maintain physiological signal stability.  

6. **PWM Block** ‚Äì Converts the stabilized ECG signal into pulse-width modulated output suitable for applications like pacemaker control.  

7. **Output Visualization** ‚Äì Displays both the corrected ECG and PWM outputs on scopes for real-time analysis.
